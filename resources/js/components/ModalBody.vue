    Thanks for checking out the project!
    <br />There is limited data in the database to generate charts with. The range of dates with zip data is Feb 28, 2020 to May 15, 2020. Not all dates in this range will have data. The date with the most data is on Feb 28, which is why it is set as the default date. That being said, try and generate the charts with no range selected or on a date with no data to see what happens!
